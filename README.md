# Pong Game

Two-player Pong game created with Python and turtle.

## Main features

- Two paddles controlled from the keyboard.
- Ball that bounces off paddles and walls.
- Scoreboard that tracks each player’s points.
- Basic increase in ball speed as the game continues.

## What I learned

- Organising code into classes (paddle, ball, scoreboard).
- Collision detection and reflection logic.
- Handling keyboard input in turtle.

## How to run

Open `main.py` in Python 3 and run the file.
